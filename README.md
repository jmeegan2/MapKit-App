# MapKit Gas Calculator

This will take two locations and give you the distance between them
Then it will ask you for the MPG of your car
It will then display the approximate cost of the trip by doing (distance / national gas price average) = cost of trip
Then it will give you the option to preview the route using MapKit and MKDirections
Going to add an API for grabbing the gas Average price so its not just a constant value

Components used
* MapKit framework with the class MKDirections
* SwiftUI
