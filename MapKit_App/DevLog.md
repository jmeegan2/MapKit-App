Issues: 
* have to make sure i add the tollsPreference to map call
* There is no free API to check for gas prices in the US, for now ill just have the user enter it, i know its one more step but I dont want to pay for an API atm
* Not sure how to format the map in the view, looks too small at the bottom, may remove later
* AppleMaps not taking tollPreference upon opening, on the dev forums people said this isnt possible but the thread was old so Im not sure 
* Difficulty adding border polyline below main polyline (asked question on stackOverflow and reddit)
* Not able to pass tollsPreference or highwayPreference when opening the maps app from mine, not sure if possible, read on old threads its not
